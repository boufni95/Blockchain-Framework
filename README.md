# GGS
### What is GGS?
GGS is a CL tool, and a Golang library
### Why did I make GGS?
For two reasons, to learn Go, and to build a library that I can use for my backend projects
### What can GGS be used for?
GGS was born as a tool to create server for games, with a simple configuration, it handles the messages and the action to play a multiplayer game, like matchmaking, object position synch and many more.
GGS later evolved in a more generic tool, that uses the same logic to handle the actions of a complete blockchain
### How's going?
Good! I'm loving this journey with Go, and I am very happy to have made this choice.
#### GGS is not ready yet, at the moment al the basic actions are handled, but the disconnection handler is still missing, I will implement them as soon as I need them.
