# Blockchain-Framework
### What is Blockchain-Framework?
Blockchain-Framework is a CL tool, and a Golang library
### Why did I make Blockchain-Framework?
For two reasons, to learn Go, and to build a library that I can use for my backend projects
### What can Blockchain-Framework be used for?
Blockchain-Framework was born as a tool to create server for games, with a simple configuration, it handles the messages and the action to play a multiplayer game, like matchmaking, object position synch and many more.
Blockchain-Framework later evolved in a more generic tool, that uses the same logic to handle the actions of a complete blockchain
### How's going?
Good! I'm loving this journey with Go, and I am very happy to have made this choice.
#### Blockchain-Framework is not ready yet, at the moment all the basic actions are handled, but the disconnection handler is still missing, I will implement them as soon as I need them.
